Traffic congestion is a growing challenge in urban environments, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify road sections based on traffic sensor data into three congestion levels: High, Medium, and Low.

By analyzing features such as vehicle count, average speed, time of day, and more, the model aims to provide accurate predictions that can assist in:

Traffic management and control systems

Urban planning and infrastructure development

Real-time route optimization for navigation apps

Reducing environmental impact by improving traffic flow

This system is ideal for integration into smart city applications or any platform that requires dynamic traffic monitoring and prediction.
